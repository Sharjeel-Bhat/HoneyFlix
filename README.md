🎯 HoneyFlix - Advanced Phishing Simulation 

HoneyFlix is a high-fidelity, Netflix-style login honeypot designed for cybersecurity research, testing, and threat intelligence gathering. It captures not only login credentials but also detailed device and browser fingerprints, providing deep insights into attacker profiles. All captured data is sent in real-time to a private Telegram chat for instant analysis.

✨ Key Features
🎭 Realistic UI: A pixel-perfect clone of the Netflix login page to serve as a convincing lure for attackers.

🔑 Credential Capture: Securely logs any submitted email and password.

🖥️ Advanced Fingerprinting: Captures detailed information about the visitor's system:

Operating System: Detects OS name and specific version (e.g., Windows 11 or other versions, Android 15.0.0 or or other versions.

Browser: Identifies browser name and specific version (e.g., Chrome 126.0.0.0, Edge 126.0.6478.127, Brave 1.68.131).

Device Type: Differentiates between Desktop and Mobile devices.

📍 Geolocation Tracking: Logs the visitor's IP Address, City, and Country using an IP lookup service.

⚡ Real-Time Alerts: Instantly sends a formatted report of all captured data to a specified Telegram chat via the Telegram Bot API.

🌐 No Backend Required: Operates as a purely static site (HTML, CSS, JS) that can be deployed for free on services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

You can host this project on any static web hosting service.
